<h1>I FINALLY made a website!</h1>
<h3>06/13/2024</h3>
<p>I've always been meaning to create a website but I would get stuck at the part of hosting 
it. But finally I solved that and created this website for everyone to enjoy! This website 
is not the most complicated website on the internet, and there's a reson why. I have-or at 
least plan to-Java applets on this site. And, well, Java applets haven't been supported by 
any major browsers for several years at this point. So I'll have to support older web browsers 
that do support Java applets, that's why the site is super simple. I hope that I'll contiune 
to support the website and make sure it doesn't end up like my Youtube Channel, where I never 
relase new content and it stays dead for several months at a time. More to come! (Hopfully.)
