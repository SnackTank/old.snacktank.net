<h1>Software</h1>
<p>I've been putting much of my effort into my new game, Laser Labyrinth. It's been pretty 
fun to program so far. The game is mostly programed in Java, more accurately the entire game 
is programed in Java. I'm planning one to day to port the code to C++ so I could compile the 
code for diffrent systems, but for now, Java is sufficient.</p>
